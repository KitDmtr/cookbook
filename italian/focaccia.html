<h1>Focaccia Bread</h1>
<h2>A delicious and easy Italian flatbread</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <span class="txtBox">
        <ul>
            <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, plus extra for sprinkling</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups warm water (105°F to 115°F)</li>
            <li>¼ cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary (optional)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, halved (optional)</li>
        </ul>       
    </span>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
    <span class="txtBox">
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, and sugar. Make a well in the center.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the warm water and salt. Pour the wet ingredients into the well of the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. The dough will be sticky.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Add a little more flour if the dough is too sticky.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a large, oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a baking sheet. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet and spread it out into a 12-inch x 16-inch rectangle, using your fingertips to gently press and dimple the dough.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the top of the dough with olive oil. Using your fingertips, make indentations all over the dough. Season generously with salt.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Top the focaccia with fresh rosemary sprigs and garlic halves, pressing them gently into the dough.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the focaccia is golden brown and crusty on top.</li>
            <li>Let the focaccia cool slightly on a wire rack before slicing and serving. Enjoy!**
