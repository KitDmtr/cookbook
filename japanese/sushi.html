<h3>Instructions</h3>
    <div class="txtBox">
        <ol>
            <h4>For the Sushi Rice:</h4>
            <li>Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running water until the water runs clear. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rinsed rice to a rice cooker and add the water. Cook according to the rice cooker instructions.</li>
            <li>While the rice is cooking, in a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat gently over low heat until the sugar and salt dissolve. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl. Pour the vinegar mixture over the hot rice and gently fold it in with a wooden spoon or rice paddle, cutting through the rice to release steam. Be careful not to crush the rice grains.</li>
            <li>Fan the rice continuously for 5-10 minutes, or until the rice cools slightly and reaches room temperature.</li>
        
            <h4>Assembly:</h4>
            <li>(Optional) If using a bamboo sushi mat, place a sheet of nori seaweed on the mat, shiny side down.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands with lightly salted water to prevent sticking. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice evenly over the nori seaweed, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Don't pack the rice too tightly.</li>
            <li>Place your chosen fillings in a horizontal line near the center of the rice. You can use a single type of filling or combine a few for variety.</li>
            <li>Using the bamboo mat (or your hands), carefully lift the bottom edge of the mat over the filling and roll up firmly, tucking the filling inside. Moisten the top border of the nori with a little water to seal the roll.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining nori and desired fillings. Cut the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces with a sharp knife, wet between cuts for clean slices.</li>
            <li>Serve sushi with wasabi paste, pickled ginger, and soy sauce for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
