    <h1>Pelmeni</h1>
    <h2>A delicious and satisfying comfort food</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="txtBox">
        <ul>
            <h4>Dough</h4>
            <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Filling:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <div class="txtBox">
        <ol>
            <h4>For the Dough:</h4>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the eggs and oil.
                Using a fork, gently beat the eggs and oil together, gradually incorporating the flour from the sides
                until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.
                Add more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30
                minutes at room temperature.</li>

            <h4>For the Filling:</h4>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and dill (if using). Mix well to
                combine.</li>

            <h4>Assembling the Pelmeni:</h4>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a thin sheet, about 1/16 inch thick. Use a 3-inch
                round cookie cutter to cut out circles from the dough. (If you don't have a cookie cutter, you can use a
                glass or the rim of a cup.)</li>
            <li>Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle. Pinch the edges together to form a
                half-moon shape, making sure to seal the filling tightly. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>

            <h4>Cooking the Pelmeni:</h4>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the pelmeni into the boiling water and cook
                for 5-7 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain.</li>
            <li>Serve pelmeni immediately with your favorite dipping sauce, such as sour cream, melted butter, or a
                simple vinegar sauce.</li>
        </ol>
